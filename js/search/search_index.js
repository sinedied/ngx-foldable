element to the same window segment.\nNote that if you have set the read direction to Right-To-Left mode (rtl)\nin CSS, the first segment will be the rightmost one.\nIf the WindowOrder option is set to

components and services to help you build dual-screen experiences for foldable or dual-screen devices, such as the Surface Duo\n\n\n  \n\n\nSee the live demo or read the full documentation.\nHow to test on your browser\nThe dual-screen emulation feature requires latest Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome versions (>= 97).\nIf you have older browser versions, you need to enable experimental flags.\nFollow the instructions here to setup your browser for dual-screen emulation.\nLibrary usage\nCheck out the demo source code to see an example usage of the library.\nAdd the library to your Angular project:\nnpm install ngx-foldableImport the library in your app:\nimport { FoldableModule } from 'ngx-foldable';\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [\n    FoldableModule\n    ...\n  ],\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Use the provided fdSplitLayout, fdWindow and fdIfSpan directives to build your layout:\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This will be displayed on the first window segment of a multi screen or single screen device.\n    \n    This is only visible on a single screen device.\n    This is only visible on a multi screen device.\n  \n\n  \n  \n    This will be displayed on the second window segment of a multi screen device.\n\n    This is only visible on multi screen device, regardless of the orientation.\n    This is only visible on dual vertical viewports.\n    This is only visible on dual horizontal viewports.\n  \nUsing the ScreenContext service, you can also receive updates when the screen context changes:\nimport { ScreenContext } from 'ngx-foldable';\n...\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(private screenContext: ScreenContext) {\n    this.screenContext\n      .asObservable()\n      .subscribe((context) => {\n        console.log('Screen context changed:', context);\n      });\n  }\n}You can read the full documentation here.\nContributing\nYou're welcome to contribute to this project!\nMake sure you have read the code of conduct before posting an issue or a pull request.\nFollow these steps to run this project locally:\n\nClone the repository on your machine\nRun npm install to install packages\nRun npm start to start the dev server with the demo app\n\nYou can then start making modifications on the library or demo app code.\nRelated work\n\nSurface Duo Photo Gallery: Angular re-implementation of the
